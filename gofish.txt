define player 1
define player 2
define standard 52 deck of cards
players 1 and 2 draw 6 diffrent cards from deck
matching 4 cards of the same suit gains one point to their owner //ex. has 4 aces
player with highest ammount of points win
player 1 goes first

while player1 && player2 have cards in their hand:
//maybe assign a key for them to press such as 1,2,3,4 etc. for the number card and letters such as A,K,Q,J
  player 1 asks for a card type that they own
  if player 2 has card:
    give them all of that type
  else if deck contains cards:
    player 1 draws one card from the remaining deck of cards 
  if player 1 has four of any one card:
    set those cards to the side creating one book.
    update player 1's score by 1.
  if player 2 has four of any one card:
    set those cards to the side creating one book.
    //int score2 
    update player 2's score by 1.
  after action is complete pass turn to player 2
  //use a while statement when it is player one's turn then use another loop for p2 
  player 2 goes for a card type that they own
  if player 1 has card:
    give them all of that type
  else if deck contains cards:
//random chance to draw any card left. use rand
    player 2 draws one card from the remaining deck of cards
  after action is complete pass turn to player 1
  if player 1 runs out of cards, player 1 draws 3 cards
  if player 2 runs out of cards, player 2 draws 3 cards
  //rather than doing nothing (because that would arouse suspicion of the code not working) have a statement saying "no more cards"
  when no more cards are left in the deck, do nothing
